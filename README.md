## Using

Simply import package: `im_avatar/avatar.dart`. Use the avatar wherever required
with support for selecting a new avatar or disable selection of specifying a new
avatar.

__Tips:__

* In case you wish to add a border, boxShadow, etc. to the avatar, simply
wrap the Avatar widget within a `Container` and add the border under `decoration`.
For circular border, also set the `boxShape` of the encompassing container to
`BoxShape.circle`.

* Use im_animation [im_animations](https://pub.dev/packages/im_animations) package
to wrap the avatar in cool animation effects.
